# Mongoose Wizard Project

This project is generated by Mongoose Wizard, https://mongoose.ws/wizard/

> This is a generic implementation, if there is an RNG in your board, it will not use it. To take advantage of all the features in your board, select your board as a target and then Zephyr at its right.

## Build and flash

**Step 1. Download generated project to your workstation**
  Click on the "sync" or ".zip" button to download the project to your workstation

**Step 2. Build and run the project**
  Follow Zephyr's guide to build for your board

## Copying functionality to an existing firmware

In order to move this functionality to some existing firmware code, copy only
the following ("purple") files:

- mongoose.{c,h}       - This is Mongoose Library, a full TCP/IP + TLS stack
- mongoose_config.h    - (only if present). Mongoose settings file
- mongoose_fs.c        - Embedded filesystem. Contains Web UI files and TLS certs
- mongoose_impl.c      - Generated network functionality
- mongoose_glue.{c,h}  - A "glue", or "binding" functions for your code

Note, the only file you should edit to integrate with your code, is
`mongoose_glue.c`. That file "glues" your firmware with the networking
functionality generated by the Mongoose Wizard. It contains functions that
return device data. Generated functions use "fake" mock data; you need to
edit those functions and return "real" device data.

Once you copy these files, add the following snippet somewhere in your code:


```c
#include "mongoose_glue.h"

...
mongoose_init();

// This blocks forever. Put this at the end of main(),
// or in a separate RTOS task. Give that task 8k stack space.
for (;;) {
  mongoose_poll();
}
```
